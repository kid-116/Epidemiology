  <p class="lead">
    With a clear example in front of us today, we know how a disease can make
    it's way through a population and cause havoc in the community. However,
    knowing a few characteristics of the disease such as - it's <strong> mode of
    transmission</strong>,<strong> mortality rate</strong>, <strong>Rate of spread</strong> etc, the disease outbreak can
    be modelled and studied and an efficient solution (vaccination routine) can
    be figured out for it. In this project, we have modelled a disease outbreak
    and used that model to generate a vaccination strategy i.e. a strategy
    concerning the minimum number of people in the<strong> population to be vaccinated</strong>
    so that the entire population is fairly protected from the disease.

        In general, an SIARD model is a compartmental model wherein individuals
        within a closed population are separated into 5 mutually exclusive
        groups or <em>compartments</em> , namely <strong>Susceptible</strong>,
        <strong>Infected</strong>, <strong>Asymptomatic</strong>, <strong>Recovered</strong> and <strong>and Deceased</strong>, based on
        their disease status. In this model, the assumed progression is for a
        susceptible individual to become infected, and an infected person to
        become recovered after a period of time.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        The SIARD model is defined by only 2 parameters: the
        <strong>effective contact rate (&beta;)</strong>, which affects the
        transition from the susceptible compartment to the infected compartment,
        and the <strong>rate of recovery (&gamma;)</strong>, which affects the
        transition from the infected compartment to the recovered compartment.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    In the SIARD model that we have implemented, we have assumed there to be 4
    compartments: Susceptible, Infected, Recovered as well as Deceased. In the
    simulation, we are predicting the progression of an epidemic in a community
    including Apartments, offices, schools, and homes over a period of one
    month. The dataset for the same has been generated using a script.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    We have also considered a group of people to be vaccinated on day 5 based on
    3 different vaccination strategies: <strong> Random </strong>Vaccination
    Strategy,<strong> Degree Based</strong> Vaccination Strategy and
    <strong> Occupation Based</strong> Strategy.

          In the contact network model, people in the community are represented
          by the <strong>nodes</strong> of the contact graph and their contacts
          are represented by the<strong> edges</strong>. Each compartment is
          assigned a color and as people move from one compartment to the other,
          the color of the nodes change accordingly.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Generally, the SIARD model randomly pairs each person with another and
          assumes that they have interacted in the timespan but this is not a
          realistic assumption as it assumes that interaction between any two
          people in the model is equiprobable which is
          <strong> not true</strong>. For example, interaction among family
          members or co-workers is much more frequent than two complete
          strangers. A contact network tracks the interaction of people in the
          model over time which is
          <strong>analogous to a real world society </strong>. Simulations using
          contact networks are therefore much more reliable and accurately mimic
          real world epidemics.

        <h4>Random Strategy</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          In this vaccination strategy, we vaccinate a given percentage of the
          total population<strong> randomly </strong>after a few days of the disease outbreak
          offset. By random we mean that we do not choose the people to
          vaccinate based on any condition, but choose them randomly from the
          population. Once we vaccinate a few people the Graph showing the
          number of susceptible, infected and recovered can be seen to take a
          drastic change, with more number of people being recovered over the
          coming days.
        </p>
        <h4>Degree Based Strategy</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          In this strategy, we take help from the contact network graph in
          identifying the nodes(people) with the <strong>highest number of contacts</strong>
          which is indicated by the highest number of distinct edges arising
          from a node, i.e. the nodes with the <strong>maximum degree</strong>. To implement this
          strategy, first the degrees of all the nodes are recorded for the
          first few days. Based on this collected data, the list of these nodes
          is then sorted in decreasing order of their degrees. Then the <strong>first k
          nodes</strong> from this sorted list are selected for vaccination where k is
          the given percentage of people out of the total population. This
          strategy evidently works better than the first one as here we are
          selectively choosing a better group of people, vaccinating whom can
          have a <strong>larger impact on the overall outbreak</strong>. Hence the graphs can be
          seen to show better recovery and lesser death than the first strategy.
        </p>
        <h4>Metadata based strategy</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          In datasets, data indicates the entities and their prime features on
          which the models will be trained. Metadata is additional data
          describing each entity. In a special dataset we considered, metadata
          included the <strong>daily routines of the people</strong>. Some routines make it
          inevitable for people to have <strong>frequent contac</strong>t with other people. For
          instance, a person from a family who has to go to office everyday is
          more likely to be in contact with a lot more people than the other
          members of the family. This way we can get a fair idea of the people
          we might have to vaccinate in order to have the best impact on the
          community. In our strategy, as mentioned earlier, we have selected k
          random people among the group of persons who have a very <strong>social
          lifestyle</strong>. (Eg : daily jobs - office).

  <h2 id="Future-target">ML based vaccination</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    As of now we have seen models which vaccinate people only based on available
    data, like the number of nodes with maximum degree out of whatever nodes
    have been introduced into the network till that given point of time, say
    time t (<em> Eg: t = 5 days</em>). Coming up with such vaccination strategies might not
    give us the best results as we don't know the rest of the contact network
    after time t. But what if there was a way to predict the best vaccination
    strategy (<em>or close to the best one</em>) by speculating the pattern of the entire
    contact network and vaccinating the right nodes based on this speculation.
    This brings us into the world of machine learning. In the future we are
    planning on using GNNs (<strong> Graph Neural Network</strong>) to identify the pattern of a
    given graph and vaccinate the best people possible. For this, we will have
    to train our model using several contact network training models (<em>datasets</em>),
    using either of the following two metrics:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="lead">
          Number of deaths in the model can be predicted and hence the right people
          can be vaccinated.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="lead">
          The people being vaccinated can be another metric we can use to train our
          model but this implementation might be a lot harder than the first one.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>How does a GNN work?</h3>
  <p class="lead">
    A graph neural network is a recent advancement in the field of neural
    networks and computer vision. <strong>Convolutional neural networks </strong>(CNN) are capable
    of identifying and analysing features from a picture fed to the computer
    (<em> this is why it's called computer vision</em>), whereas GNNs are used to
    visualize graphs and make appropriate predictions. In each layer of a GNN, a
    node in the graph is embedded with the features of its adjacent nodes, i.e.
    apart from having it's own features, a node from the graph can be used to
    obtain some features of it's adjacent nodes and hence <strong> predict a node given
    it's adjacent nodes</strong>. The more number of layers there are in a GNN, the more
    embedding takes place and hence predictions are more accurate. However, if
    there are too many layers in the GNN, <strong>overfitting </strong>takes place, i.e. the GNN
    gives a highly accurate prediction for specific cases but fails to give good
    results for any general case.
